# TextToASCIIBlock for C++ and Python

This is a small C++ function that converts an Input String to an ASCII Art-like Textblock as Output. SWIG-Binding for Python will be included.

Example:

Input: 
Stewie is cool

Output:
```

## Installation
### Usage in C++
#### Requirements
* C++ Compiler, I use gcc 9.3.0, but others should work too.
* GNU Make 4.3 or higher if you want to use the makefile
#### Running
For usage in C++ Projects, simply Â´#include "ConvString.h"`, only `STL` is required. For an example, you can make the example by running with the provided makefile.

### Usage in Python 
#### Requirements
In order to build the python library I recommend:
* SWIG 3.0.12 or higher
* C++ Compiler, I recommend gcc 9.3.0 or higher
* Python 3 or higher

The software comes with a SWIG interface that allows you to run the decoder in Python.
You can build the software on your machine with the provided `setup.py` file.
Simply run:
``
 swig -c++ -python ascii_block.i
``
Expected output is no output.
``
 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
``
Expected output:
``
running build_ext
building '_ascii_block' extension
creating build
(... Compiler output without errors or warnings ...)

``
Afterwards, run
``
 python test.py
``

Expected output can be seen in the top (Stewie is cool). For an explanation of this, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PD8W2OogE0
